# Budgey - a CLI budgeting tool

This tool aims to be a feature rich budget tracker to help manage your finances, all from the command line!

### Concepts 
Repository - a central location for a budget.

Piles - a pot of money within a repository, allocated for a specific purpose (e.g. groceries, rent, savings). 
You have a default pile for each repository, but you can create as many as you like.

Transactions - a record of money moving in and out of a pile.
