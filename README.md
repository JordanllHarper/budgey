# Budgey - a CLI budgeting tool

### Concepts 
Repository - a central location for all budgets.

Transactions - a record of money moving in and out of a budget.

Piles - a pot of money within a budget, allocated for a specific purpose (e.g. groceries, rent, savings). 
You have a default pile for each budget, but you can create as many as you like.
